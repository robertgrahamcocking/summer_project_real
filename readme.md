*The data is originally from https://www.hesa.ac.uk/, via https://www.jisc.ac.uk/tailored-datasets, supplied to the Institute of Physics.
This data is then rounded and anonymised in line with HESA guidance https://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/rounding-and-suppression-anonymise-statistics
and later published to Tableau Public.*

The rounding strategy was detailed in the project proposal- the code is available.
